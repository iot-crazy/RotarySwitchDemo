# RotarySwitchDemo
Demonstration of a rotary encoder switch on a Heltec Wifi LoRa 32

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This code was written using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which provides a much richer environment that the Arduino IDE we have used in other projects. However, the code would probably work in the Arduino IDE if the correct libraries are referenced.

You will need:
1. A Heltec WiFi LoRa 32
2. A rotarty encoder switch such as the HW-40
4. Connecting wires

### Installing

1. Clone the repo to your local computer, or copy the .ino file.
2. Connect the rotary encoder to your board
3. Upload the code
4. Enjoy!

Debug and telemetry data are also output to the serial port to allow testing without the client device.


#Tested On
This demonstration is intended for the Heltec Wifi LoRa 32 and therefore has only been tested on this device.
